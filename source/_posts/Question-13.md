```bash
var trees = ["xyz", "xxxx", "test", "ryan", "apple"];
delete trees[3];
console.log(trees.length);
```
The code above will output `5` as output. When we used `delete` operator for deleting an array element then, the array length is not affected by this. This holds even if you deleted all elements of an array using `delete` operator.

So when delete operator removes an array element that deleted element is no longer present in the array. In place of value at deleted index undefined x 1 in chrome and undefined is placed at the index. If you do `console.log(trees)` output `["xyz", "xxxx", "test", undefined Ã— 1, "apple"]` in Chrome and in Firefox `["xyz", "xxxx", "test", undefined, "apple"]`.
