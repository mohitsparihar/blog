```bash
var salary = "1000$";

(function () {
  console.log("Original salary was " + salary);

  var salary = "5000$";

  console.log("My New Salary " + salary);
})();
```
The code above will output: `undefined, 5000$` because of hoisting. In the code presented above, you might be expecting `salary` to retain it values from outer scope until the point that `salary` was re-declared in the inner scope. But due to `hoisting` salary value was `undefined` instead. To understand it better have a look of the following code, here `salary` variable is hoisted and declared at the top in function scope. When we print its value using `console.log` the result is `undefined`. Afterwards the variable is redeclared and the new value `"5000$"` is assigned to it.
```bash
var salary = "1000$";

(function () {
  var salary = undefined;
  console.log("Original salary was " + salary);

  salary = "5000$";

  console.log("My New Salary " + salary);
})();
```
